# Handwritten-Text-Recognition
The link for the dataset is available in Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vaibhao/handwritten-characters. It is a 2GB dataset with train, test and validation data

Methodology: 🔍 Data Collection: Collect a large dataset of handwritten samples containing both characters and emojis. This dataset should cover various handwriting styles, sizes, and orientations.

📊 Data Preprocessing: Preprocess the collected data by resizing images to a consistent size, converting them to grayscale, and normalizing pixel values to improve model training efficiency.

🧠 Model Architecture: Design a CNN architecture suitable for the task of handwriting recognition. This architecture typically includes convolutional layers for feature extraction and pooling layers for downsampling, followed by fully connected layers for classification.

🛠️ Training: Train the CNN model using the preprocessed dataset. During training, the model learns to extract features from input images and predict the corresponding characters or emojis.

🔎 Validation: Validate the trained model on a separate validation dataset to assess its performance and fine-tune hyperparameters if necessary. This step helps ensure that the model generalizes well to unseen data.

📈 Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. This step provides insights into how well the model performs at recognizing both characters and emojis.

🔧 Optimization: Optimize the model by adjusting parameters, experimenting with different architectures, and exploring advanced techniques such as data augmentation and regularization to improve performance further.

🚀 Deployment: Deploy the trained model into production, where it can be integrated into applications or systems for real-time handwriting recognition. Ensure that the deployment environment meets the model's requirements for performance and scalability.

🔄 Iterative Improvement: Continuously monitor the model's performance in the production environment and gather feedback. Iterate on the model by retraining with updated data and fine-tuning to adapt to evolving handwriting patterns and user needs.

By following these processes, you can develop an OCR system using CNNs capable of accurately recognizing handwritten characters.
